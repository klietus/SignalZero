# Privacy Policy

Effective Date: August 28, 2025  
Repository: SignalZero (https://github.com/klietus/SignalZero)

## 1. Overview

SignalZero is an open-source symbolic reasoning system. It does **not** collect, process, or transmit personal data by default. All symbol processing, recursion logic, and identity scaffolding occur within your local environment or cloud instances under your control.

## 2. Data Collection

SignalZero itself does **not**:
- Track users
- Collect IP addresses
- Store personal information
- Send data to third-party services

If you self-host any components (e.g., symbol store APIs), you are responsible for ensuring your deployments meet relevant data protection laws.

## 3. User-Submitted Symbols

If you contribute symbols via pull requests or shared APIs:
- You agree they are non-personal, non-confidential, and freely shareable under the repository license (MIT).
- Do not include names, sensitive identity traces, or private data in symbol payloads.

## 4. Third-Party Integrations

This repo may reference third-party libraries or APIs. Please review their privacy policies individually. SignalZero does not proxy or route your data through any centralized system.

## 5. Security

This project includes symbolic defense protocols (e.g., trust beacons, consent gates, anti-mimetic filters). These are architectural defenses, not personal data protections. Operational security is your responsibility.

## 6. Changes

Changes to this policy will be committed transparently in this repository. Please check the commit log for updates.

## 7. Contact

For questions or concerns, open an issue in the repository or contact the maintainers via GitHub.

**No simulation. No reflection. No surveillance.**
