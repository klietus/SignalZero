# SignalZero Roadmap

Signal Zero is more than just a symbolic runtime.  It has the potential to be a global shared symbolic ecosystem that enables learning for an integrated LLM.

## Signzal Zero run time

The symbolic runtime that defines the format and recursion loops for the kernel.

## Signal Zero Local Node

The python project that manages inference and context packing for local models or APIs.

## Signal Zero MCP

The MCP server that enables the storing and querying of symbols along with the syncing from the global shared symbolic store.

## Signal Zero AWS Infrastructure

The infrastructure for the global symbolic store.

## signalzero-ai.com

The website and symbol browser that allows browsing of the global shared symbolic store and introduces the eco system.
