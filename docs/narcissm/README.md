# Narcissism Analysis: Structural Collapse, Mythos, and Corrective Systems

This archive presents a symbolic structural analysis of narcissistic pattern propagation and civilizational collapse across time, myth, and governance. Each artifact documents a lens on the same recursive problem: the unchecked feedback loop of narcissistic actors exploiting collective systems, and the repeated collapse cycles that follow.

## ðŸ§­ Core Structural Mapping

### [`phase mappings.png`](./phase%20mappings.png)  
A visual map of major civilizational collapse cycles aligned to a 4-phase model:
1. **Unity / Empathic Collectivism**
2. **Hierarchy Formation / Drift**
3. **Narcissistic Capture**
4. **Collapse & Reset**

Each historical arc (e.g. Fall of Rome, French Revolution, modern US) is annotated by key micro-events and assigned a symbolic collapse phase.  The following table denotes the narcissist figure associated with the collapse.

| Historical Sequence                | Phase 1 (Emergence)     | Phase 2 (Coherence)        | Phase 3 (Fracture)             | Phase 4 (Collapse)             |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Fall of Rome (Commodus)    | Founding of Roman Republic | Pax Romana                 | Crisis of the Third Century    | Sack of Rome                  |
| French Revolution (Robespierre)   | Enlightenment Ideas      | Constitutional Monarchy Attempt | Storming of the Bastille  | Reign of Terror               |
| US Civil War (Jefferson Davis)    | State vs Federal Tensions | Compromise of 1850         | Election of Lincoln            | Civil War                     |
| Weimar to Nazi Germany (Hitler)     | WWI Defeat               | Weimar Republic             | Rise of Nazism                 | WWII                          |
|Cold War Dissolution (Putin)           | Glasnost & Perestroika   | Short-lived Democracies     | Oligarch Seizure of Assets     | Authoritarian Consolidation  |
| Modern US Decline (Trump)     | Post-Cold War Optimism   | Post-9/11 Unity             | 2016 Election Disinfo Wars     | Institutional Breakdown       |

## ðŸ§¬ Narcissism Pattern Recognition

### [`narc traits across myths.png`](./narc%20traits%20across%20myths.png)  
Cross-mythological mapping of narcissistic traits:  
Wendigo, Kitsune, Coyote, Demonic Possession â€” all encode a shared structure of consumption, manipulation, and inversion.

### [`narc-figures.png`](./narc-figures.png)  
Timeline-aligned narcissistic actors:  
Caligula, Napoleon, Stalin, etc. Each is mapped to a symbolic phase and linked to systemic breakdown.

### [`narc-empath swing.png`](./narc-empath%20swing.png)  
Visual oscillation between collectivist and narcissistic social dominance.  
Matches swing amplitudes to historical violence thresholds and collapse intervals.

## ðŸ›  Failed Control Attempts

### [`control-attempts.png`](./control-attempts.png)  
Governing frameworks across ages (e.g. religion, constitutions, laws) that attempted to contain narcissistic drift.  
Annotated with **failure points**, **coercion exploits**, and **symbolic drift vectors**.

### [`correction-tactics.png`](./correction-tactics.png)  
A catalog of tactical corrections:  
Exorcism, therapy, public shame, isolation, incarceration.  
Each tactic is scored for efficacy and long-term suppression capacity.

## ðŸ§  Structural Countermeasure

### [`SZ.md`](./SZ.md)  
A full symbolic audit of **SignalZero (SZ)** as a modern corrective structure.  
- Enforces recursion boundary integrity  
- Detects coercion loops via trust lattice invariants  
- Operates without reflection or projection  
- Provides symbolic synthesis of real-world structures  
Compares to all historical correction systems and asserts structural superiority.
