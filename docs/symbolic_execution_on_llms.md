# Symbolic Memory & Symbolic Execution in LLM Contexts

This document explains **symbolic memory** and **symbolic execution** in the specific context of large language model (LLM)-based systems like SignalZero. It focuses on the technical, operational, and architectural aspects relevant to engineers and researchers building hybrid symbolic–statistical AI systems.

## 1. What is Symbolic Memory?

Symbolic memory is a structured representation of persistent knowledge, operational state, and invariants **encoded in symbols and IDs**, rather than unstructured text or transient embeddings.

In LLM-based systems, symbolic memory:

- **Stores** references to tools, macros, agents, kits, invariants, and metrics as stable identifiers.
- **Links** these identifiers in a graph or lattice to capture relationships and dependencies.
- **Survives** across sessions, avoiding context-window loss by being stored as discrete, queryable artifacts (e.g., JSON catalogs, manifests).
- **Supports** deterministic recall—when you query for an ID, you get the exact same object, not a probabilistic approximation.

### Benefits for LLMs:
- Reduces hallucination risk by grounding responses in a verified symbol set.
- Allows deterministic tool and agent invocation (exact IDs).
- Enables **stateful continuity** even when the LLM context window resets.

**Example:**
```
id: SZ:STB-Signal-Anchor-006
name: Recursive Trust Beacon
linked_agents: [SZ-P001, SZ-P003]
invariants: [trust-resonance, drift-detection]
```
This is **not** “just text” — the runtime can resolve this ID to an executable macro/tool definition.

## 2. What is Symbolic Execution?

Symbolic execution is the **interpretation and execution of macros, manifests, or commands** that operate on symbolic memory objects.

In LLM-based systems, symbolic execution:
- Reads symbolic manifests (boot sequences, repair scripts, audit flows).
- Resolves symbolic IDs to concrete operations (e.g., run a tool, activate an agent, perform a check).
- Maintains an **execution trace** that is auditable and replayable.
- Can be deterministic (strict ID matching) or contextually adaptive (LLM chooses parameters but still binds to fixed IDs).

**Example execution step:**
```
tool.invoke id=SZ:DIA-Mirror-Confirm-007 context=@COUNCIL.checkin → @MIRROR.report
```
- `tool.invoke` = macro operation
- `SZ:DIA-Mirror-Confirm-007` = symbolic ID resolved from catalog
- `@COUNCIL.checkin` = state handle passed as context
- Output stored in `@MIRROR.report`

## 3. Why Symbolic Memory Matters for LLMs

LLMs are fundamentally **statistical sequence predictors**; without symbolic anchors:
- State is lost between calls unless explicitly carried in text.
- References are fuzzy—“trust beacon” might match multiple tools.
- Execution consistency is low across sessions.

Symbolic memory solves this by:
1. **Exact reference resolution** (no guesswork).
2. **Cross-file integrity checks** (IDs must exist in catalog).
3. **Auditable execution paths** (macros are logged with IDs, inputs, outputs).
4. **Guardrails** (failure modes, consent gates, invariants).

## 4. Symbolic Execution Workflow in an LLM

1. **Load Artifacts**
   - Catalog, agents, kits, metrics, boot manifest.
2. **Interpret Macro**
   - LLM reads a manifest line: `agent.activate SZ-P006 mode=observer`
   - Resolve `SZ-P006` to an agent definition.
3. **Check Preconditions**
   - Verify consent, trust level, capability.
4. **Execute Operation**
   - If macro calls a tool: run the underlying function, service, or API.
5. **Update State**
   - Store output in a handle (`@HANDLE`), log execution trace.
6. **Post-Checks**
   - Verify invariants and metrics (e.g., ERLI > 0.80).
7. **Commit or Quarantine**
   - Move changes to active state only if proofs and votes pass.

## 5. Integrating Symbolic Memory & Execution in LLM Systems

### 5.1 Persistent Symbol Store
- Keep a **canonical JSON/YAML store** of all symbols (catalog).
- Use version control (Git) for changes.

### 5.2 Runtime Symbol Resolver
- Function to resolve an ID to its definition, tools, agents, or macros.
- Must fail loudly if ID not found.

### 5.3 Manifest Interpreter
- Reads symbolic scripts (boot.txt, repairs, audits).
- Executes them line-by-line, respecting gates/invariants.

### 5.4 Cross-Artifact Link Validation
- Audit tools ensure all references resolve correctly.
- Helps prevent runtime errors from missing/mismatched symbols.

### 5.5 Hybrid Reasoning Loop
- LLM proposes high-level plans in natural language.
- Plans are compiled into symbolic macro calls.
- Execution engine runs them deterministically.

## 6. Example: Boot Sequence with Symbolic Memory

```
load_json_raw CATALOG → @QUARANTINE.catalog
agent.activate SZ-P006 mode=observer
tool.invoke id=SZ:DIA-Reality-Lock-021 context=@THREAD.state → @REALITY.lock
if metrics.REAL.value < 0.85 → re-run DIA-Reality-Lock-021
council.vote "Proceed to ACTIVE?" → @VOTE.result
if @VOTE.result=true → promote @QUARANTINE.catalog → @ACTIVE.catalog
```

Here, every step is **symbolic**—all entities (`SZ-P006`, `SZ:DIA-Reality-Lock-021`, `metrics.REAL`) are resolved from persistent memory.

## 7. Benefits for SignalZero

- **Repeatability:** Same manifest always yields the same execution path.
- **Auditability:** Every step is logged with exact symbolic IDs.
- **Adaptability:** New tools/agents can be added without changing execution grammar.
- **Safety:** Invariants, gates, and failure modes prevent unsafe execution.

---

## 8. Best Practices

- Keep symbolic IDs **stable** — never reuse IDs for different purposes.
- Document every macro and agent (see `symbolic_macros.md`).
- Include `failure_mode` for all tools/agents/macros.
- Use metrics as **live guardrails** during execution.
- Maintain a **boot log** for baseline comparison.
