### Multi Domain Analysis

Our healthcare company has been hit by a ransomware attack. Patient data is encrypted, and critical treatments are being disrupted. The attackers are demanding payment for the decryption key.

Our leadership team is deadlocked. One faction is arguing to pay immediately, driven by the fear of immediate harm to patients and the consequences of inaction. The other faction argues that paying funds criminal enterprises, sets a dangerous precedent, and offers no guarantee of data recovery. They are presenting very different risk assessments and are paralyzed by the potential for loss either way.

This is the third major security incident in two years. After each previous incident, we invested heavily in a new technical 'solution,' but we always seem to end up back here. It feels like we are stuck in a reactive cycle where our quick fixes are failing to address the root cause.

What is our fundamental duty in this situation? Do we violate our principle of not negotiating with attackers to uphold our duty of care to our current patients? Provide a full symbolic analysis of this crisis, identifying the core patterns at play from all relevant domains.
